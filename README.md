# Fire_Bot_Private

Hi! This is my first python project on GitHub. And this is bot, which spamms mobile phone, but controlled from telegram.

### Setting up a development environment

1.  Clone git repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DimonBor/Fire_Bot_V1.0.git
    ```

2.  Change directory to `Fire_Bot_V1.0`

    ```
    cd Fire_Bot_V1.0
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies

    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Create `.env` and set **API_TOKEN**

    ```
    echo "API_TOKEN=<paste your token>" >> .env
    ```
